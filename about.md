## Professional Experience

I worked for 3 years as a PhD researcher for an institute that develops nanosatellites ([CSU](https://csu.edu.umontpellier.fr/en/home/), University of Montpellier, France). During that time, I developed a communications link simulator based on an IoT protocol for Low Power Wide Area Networks. My focus was on evaluating and proposing novel, high-performance MAC algorithms exploiting advanced signal processing techniques, aiming at implementing these protocols in nanosatellite platforms. The results of this work were accepted for publication and ultimately lead me to obtain my PhD in electronics engineering (thesis manuscript [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01951803/document)).

After that I worked for 1.5 years as an R&D blockchain engineer and full-stack developer in a project I co-founded: legacydapp.com (based in Toulouse, France). I was mainly in charge of designing the architecture, writing the [whitepaper](https://github.com/legacynetwork/whitepaper/raw/master/main.pdf) and helping implementing an [MVP](https://github.com/legacynetwork/MVP) (using truffle + vuejs + solidity and some Django). In parallel, I co-founded with some of Legacy's team members a blockchain consulting company: chainimpact.io. Here I worked in early-stage projects helping companies doing R&D and developing blockchain-based prototypes on both private and public chains.

Before my PhD I did a 6-month internship as my master's final project with Airbus Defence and Space (Toulouse, France). My work was about evaluating the use of 4G/LTE for space communications through computer simulation.

Finally, since I started university, I've been interested in web design and development and have worked in several small projects for friends and clients. So I'm very familiar with HTML/CSS/javascript and I consider myself as someone with good taste in design.
