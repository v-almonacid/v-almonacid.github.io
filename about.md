## Professional Experience

### 2022 - 2024

| Main stack | `react` `typescript` `react-native` `TailwindCSS` `ionic` `django`|

I led a small frontend team to build [Alphaday](https://app.alphaday.com), a web app where you can create custom crypto dashboards, and [Pulse](https://getpulse.xyz), a mobile app to help you stay
up-to-date with everything crypto. Pulse was released in March and by the moment I'm writing these lines it's serving +50k users.

### 2019 - 2021

| Main stack | `react` `flow/typescript` `react-native` `redux` `rust`|

On April 2019 I joined the [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io) R&D team to help developing [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com) and contribute to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.
I was the main developer of Yoroi mobile, which was by then the most popular mobile wallet on Cardano.

Some features and projects I completed during my time at Emurgo:

- Self-custodial staking: We were perhaps the first mobile wallet that supported decentralized, self-custodial staking directly from your phone.
- Ledger Nano X/S integration
- React-native bindings: I wrote native bindings to Cardano's rust library. This open source package allows mobile developers to interact with the Cardano blockchain natively, without the need
  for intermediaries.
- Multiple library updates due to the constant and rapid evolution of the Cardano blockchain during those years.
- Support for Cardano DAO voting (Catalyst) project.
- Payment URIs: I co-authored a Cardano Improvement Proposal to establish `web+cardano://` as a URI protocol to handle payments using QRs, which we then integrated in Yoroi.

### 2017 - 2018

| Main stack | `vuejs` `solidity` `truffle` `django`|

I got into crypto and blockchain at about the same time I was finishing my PhD thesis. For the next ~1.5 years, I worked as an R&D blockchain engineer and full-stack developer in a project I co-founded: legacydapp.com (based in Toulouse, France). I was mainly responsible of designing the architecture, writing the [whitepaper](https://github.com/legacynetwork/whitepaper/raw/master/main.pdf) and helping implementing an [MVP](https://github.com/legacynetwork/MVP) (using `truffle` + `vuejs` + `solidity` and some `Django`). In parallel, I co-founded with some of Legacy's team members a blockchain consulting company: chainimpact.io. Here I worked in early-stage projects helping companies doing R&D and developing blockchain proof of concepts.

### 2014 - 2017

I worked for 3 years as a PhD researcher for an institute that develops nanosatellites ([CSU](https://csu.edu.umontpellier.fr/en/home/), University of Montpellier, France).
During that time, I developed a communications link simulator based on an IoT protocol for Low Power Wide Area Networks. My focus was on evaluating and proposing novel, high-performance MAC algorithms exploiting advanced signal processing techniques, aiming at implementing these protocols in nanosatellite platforms. The results of this work were accepted for publication and ultimately lead me to obtain my PhD in electronics engineering (thesis manuscript [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01951803/document)).

### 2013

I did a 6-month internship as my master's final project with Airbus Defence and Space (Toulouse, France). My work was about evaluating the use of 4G/LTE signal processing techniques for space communications through computer simulation (MATLAB).

## Other Interests

I love mountains and being in Nature. I enjoy rock climbing and alpinism.

I also used to play the electric guitar in [Cold Blossom](https://soundcloud.com/coldblossom/), an alternative-rock band based in Toulouse, France.
