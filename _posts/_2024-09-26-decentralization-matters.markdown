Does crypto still makes sense? In this post I'll expand on some conclusions I've been drawing over the last couple of years as a developer working in the industry.

## Feeling Bearish: Scams, Hacks and the American Politicization of Crypto

After the major crypto scandals of 2022, namely the fall of FTX and Terra, I started to question myself on whether working in crypto was actually a good thingâ€”both for society as a whole and for myself as an individual. I personally have not been economically harmed by any of this, but many, many others were. Over a couple of months after the events, I saw multiple posts in reddit from crypto users asking for help because they lost everything. All their life savings, gone. (Yes, these users probably have very poor notions of risk management, and may be partially responsible for what happened to them, but that is not the main point here). It was difficult to keep doing my job undisturbed.

Add to that the countless scams and hacks that we keep seeing on a weekly basis. If you think this is an overstatement, just head over [web3isgoinggreat.com](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/) to confirm. All of these issues affected my confidence on whether the introduction of blockchain, and in particular, smart-contract platforms that enabled the proliferation of new crypto assets, would end up being a net positive contribution to humanity.

Finally, there is the North-American politicization of crypto. On the one side, there has been a questionable attack on crypto by the SEC and the Biden administration. I am in favor of more and better regulation for crypto, but the logic by which the SEC operates is simply incomprehensible for me. In response, many prominent, right-wing _crypto bros_ and libertarians have risen up literally declaring a war on crypto. So right now it appears to the general public that everyone who is pro crypto is a Republican or a right-wing libertarian. I personally feel very uncomfortable with this reductionism, as I lean more to a progressive liberalist way of thinking. Don't get me wrong, crypto _is_ a political matter. It has obvious political consequences, as most technologies do. But it shouldn't be a partisan issue.

After all these negative events I've reached a point where I avoid telling others that I was a developer working in crypto. In this scenario, you naturally ask yourself: Does this whole crypto thing still make any sense?

My short answer is still yes. Let's dig deeper why.

## Crypto's Superpower: Bitcoin

The ability to access a permisionless, decentralized network that allows you to store value with reasonable volatility and transact with any other network peer with no restrictions whatsoever, is still crypto's main value proposition. This is what Bitcoin represents.
For a long time, I wasn't not a big fan of Bitcoin because of its environmental footprint. The massive amount of energy required to run the network was for me a major source of cognitive dissonance. With time, I came to realize that Bitcoin's value was so big that it may justify its cost. Also, I've seen interesting development in the use of mining to increase the efficiency of renewable energy plants.

- Crypto became a political issue, ergo it is important
- New problems introduced by AI may make crypto relevant in ways we are still not aware of

# The Crypto Paradox

There are many problems for which I think of crypto for a possible solution. We want to have a fast way to take decisions in small to medium scale groups of people using advanced voting techniques? Crypto can be great for that. We noticed AI is doing a massive Sybil attack on the Internet and we need ways to help us figure out whether we are interacting with real users, but at the same time protect the users' private data? Crypto can help with that.
