# Hi!

I’m Vicente, a software engineer with seven years of experience primarily focused on blockchain and Web3 technologies.

My main stack is: `React`, `React Native` and `Typescript`.

And I often work with `Python/Django`, `Solidity` and `Rust`.

I'm constantly learning new things. I'm now particularly interested in AI/LLMs/Langchain/Agents/RAG Pipelines.

## Some relevant experience

- Crypto wallets: For over 2 years, I was the lead developer of [Yoroi Mobile](https://yoroi-wallet.com/), the most popular mobile Cardano Wallet.
- Building and maintaining apps in production: I led a frontend team to build [app.alphaday.com](https//app.alphaday.com) (customizable crypto dashboards & portfolio) and [Pulse](http://getpulse.xyz) (user-friendly mobile crypto news aggregator)—both from scratch.
- Open source crypto infrastructure: I wrote a React Native [Cardano SDK](https://github.com/Emurgo/csl-mobile-bridge). It enables developers to create mobile apps that interact with the Cardano blockchain.

### Startup Experience

- In 2017, I co-founded Legacy, a death man' switch to manage your crypto-assets when you die. Legacy was a [finalist](https://medium.com/legacy-network/we-made-it-4677673ee6bf) in Cofound.it's acceleration program. You can check Legacy's whitepaper, which I co-authored, [here](https://github.com/legacynetwork/whitepaper/blob/master/main.pdf).
- Around the same time, I co-founded ChainImpact, a consultancy firm focused on blockchain.

### Research Experience

- I hold a PhD in electronics (satellite communications engineering). I worked on low-level protocols for satellite, machine-to-machine communications.

You can read more about my background [here](/about/).
