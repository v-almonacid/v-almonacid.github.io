# Hi!

I’m Vicente, a software engineer who has been mostly working as a frontend developer on blockchain/web3 for the last 7 years.

My main stack is: `React/React Native/Typescript`.

And I often work with Python/Django, Solidity and Rust.

I'm constantly learning new things. I'm now particularly interested in AI/LLMs/Langchain/Agents/RAG Pipelines.

## Some relevant experience

- Crypto wallets: For over 2 years, I was the lead developer of [Yoroi Mobile](https://yoroi-wallet.com/), the most popular Cardano Wallet.
- Building and maintaining apps in production: I led a frontend team to build [app.alphaday.com](https//app.alphaday.com) (customizable crypto dashboards & portfolio) and [Pulse](http://getpulse.xyz) (user-friendly mobile crypto news aggregator)—both from scratch.
- Open source crypto infrastructure: I wrote React Native bindings for Cardano's Rust library. It allows any developer to create mobile apps that can interact with the Cardano blockchain.

### Startup Experience

- In 2017, I co-founded Legacy, a death man' switch to manage your crypto-assets when you die.
- Around the same time, I co-founded ChainImpact, a consultancy firm focused on blockchain.

### Research Experience

- I hold a PhD in electronics (satellite communications engineering). I worked on low-level protocols for satellite, machine-to-machine communications.
